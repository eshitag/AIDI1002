### BERT: A Revolutionary Language Model for Natural Language Processing

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model designed to understand language like humans do. One of the most significant advantages of BERT is that it requires less labeled data than previous models, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect. BERT has also inspired further research into developing new and improved language representation models, which are driving the field of NLP forward.

#### Overview
In this project we have considered the approach of training the model by deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text, allowing it to consider both left and right context in all layers. This makes it more effective at capturing the full meaning of a text sequence, even in cases where the meaning may not be immediately apparent from the preceding context.
